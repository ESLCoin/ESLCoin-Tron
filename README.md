## ESL Coin TRX - English As A Second Language
ESL Coin TRX is a the Tron based fork implementation of [ESL Coin](http://eslcoin.org), a community project that is set to disrupt the 84 Billion dollar language learning industry. Running in parallel with its ETH cousin where high gas fees are an issue, ESL Coin TRX will enjoy the benefits of low gas fees offered by the Tronix ecosystem making microtransactions possible. 

## Background

English has been the effective lingua franca since the ascendance of the British Empire in the 19th century. It is still used as a common global language to this day, and proficiency is especially prized in countries competing to export to the massive combined economy of the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain and Ireland. This has created a global industry worth billions of dollars; in rich manufacturing centers such as South Korea, there are even celebrity ESL tutors making seven figures! Students from all over the world learn English from native English teachers—often traveling to dedicated schools overseas—forming a robust community with its own Meetups and conferences. Our team includes highly qualified ESL professionals with years of experience in the industry, and we are partnered with established ESL organizations. This includes one of the largest related Meetups and Facebook pages in the world, whose growing online community created the need for our upcoming blockchain-powered ESL app.

## Challenge

While we take English for granted, there are billions who are eager to learn the English language but are prevented from doing so due to many existing barriers in the current English learning system from cost barriers to inefficient distribution systems and poor proficiency testing systems. The limitations in the current system has resulted in varying education levels across the board often only the wealthy could afford quality education and are often charged astronomical rates for language schools. The inefficiencies and lack of transparency in the education delivery & grading system has resulted in many exploits where profiteering schools & exam providers are known to ‘sell language proficiency levels’ to language learners based on their ability to pay and not their accomplishments in learning.

Globalization and the rise of technology have allowed many to have access to the internet. One of our goals is to make English learning accessible from anywhere in the world regardless of social economic background. We seek to create a blockchain system that removes inefficiencies and provide the benefits of blockchain to the language learning space. As long as you have a phone and internet connection, you can be connected to a global network of native speakers who can help you learn and become more fluent at communicating in English.

## Team
The ESL Coin TRX team consists of language teachers, community builders and developers with a passion to make English learning a possibility to everyone around the world regardless of socio econoimc backgrounds. The ESL Coin TRX team is not related to the ESL Coin Eth team but we do hope to work together when we reach Phase Professor (Cross Chain Compatability).

## Opportunity

ESL Coin TRX seeks to create a Tron based blockchain ecosystem that will be based around the token, ESL Coin TRX. 

## Roadmap

The ecosystem will be launched in multiple phases:

1. (Student) Technical Launch
2. (Tutor) dApp ecosystem development
3. (Graduate) Public launch
4. (Teacher) Governance & DAO implementation
5. (Professor) Cross chain compatability
6. (Dean) Outreach & Partnerships with language testing bodies & academic instutions 

## Tokenomics
The Tron implmentation of ESL Coin will consist of an initial technical launch phase through an auction with a daily emission starting at 1 million tokens. The tokens emitted will decrease over time to ensure price stability. A development pool of 30 Million premine is retained by the development team and will be unlocked overtime for the purpose of:
-dApp development
-Promotion & growth via youtubers and influencers
-Team milestones
-charter members

## Technical launch
The purpose of a technical launch is to raise awareness of the ESLCoin TRX token within the technical community, create a development fund for the Tron division of the team and build up a liquidity fund for the future exchange implementation. The technical launch will be conducted through an initial auction series with a daily emission stating at 1 Million token a day and reducing every day. Unlike Initial Coin Offerings, the intended audience are technical investors/participants and developers who do believe in creating an ecosystem to disrupt the 80 Billion dollars language learning space. As a result, no UI is created for the technical launch and anyone wanting to participate must interact directly with the smart contract. To reward token particpants during this stage, 95% of the daily auction is shared among token stakers. 

More information on how to interact with the smart contract can be found at our [smart contract tutorial page](https://eslcoin.github.io/smart-contract-tutorial).

Technical participants can elect to be part of the charter members program and receive a share of day 1 and 2 auction revenue see [charter members program](https://eslcoin.github.io/charter-members). 

Non technical partipants can partake in this project throguh other means. See our [get invovled page](https://eslcoin.github.io/get-invovled) for more information. 

## Governance and DAO
ESLCoin TRX will eventaully evolve into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) such that token holders can participate in the governance and operations of the ecosystem. 

## Ecosystem dApps in development

### TryEnglish App
ESL Coin’s first decentralized app has its origins in the Conversational English Meetup group, which is one of the largest in the world with over 21,000 followers on Facebook (all organic). It also spawned related chat rooms on Skype, WhatsApp and KakaoTalk where ESL students practice English with one another and search for or share resources.

Over the years, however, our group outgrew existing chat platforms, many of which have serious moderation issues and none of which are dedicated specifically to ESL students. The TryEnglish app will better facilitate English practice conversation with a variety of additional features, using the ESL Coin network to help connect them with schools, homestays and other services they may need.

### TutorMatch
TutorMatch is the 'Tinder' match making service connecting English native speakers **(Language Buddies)** with ESL learners. TutorMatch makes it possible for native learners to make a passive income on the go simply by particpating in casual conversations with english learners. English learners can pick and choose their language buddy and tutors simply by swiping left or right. Rewards for native speakers are based on length of conversation, quality of conversation (rating from english learner) and overall reputation. Native speakers with higher reputation level can qualify to become an english tutor which unlocks more rewards.  

Using ESLCoin TRX, micropayments can be made possible without the worries of high gas fees on the Ethereum platform. 

## Academic record Transmission
The current legacy system requires the use of postal service to send physical academic transacripts and test scores to different institutions. Often times, transcripts and test certificates are prone to foagery. Using the power of smart contracts, school grades and exam scores can be stored onto the blockchain ensuring transparency, immutability and availability.

```markdown
**Process**
1. Proctors test students, transmitting the test scores to them via the ESL Network or more traditional encrypted channels.
2. Raw scores may be uploaded to the blockchain—making them accessible to all—for students not concerned about academic privacy.
3. Encrypted scores are submitted by proctors to the blockchain. Uploads are done in bulk, thus paying less fees to the miners.
4. Decryption keys are transmitted to to the schools to which students have applied.
5. Scores are decrypted from the blockchain. Reading from it has no cost, so transmission is always free.
6. Students attend the accepting school of their choice, sending ESL Coin and receiving their grades.
7. Other academic records such as grades may be transmitted as by proctors for ESL students transferring to other schools and universities.
8. All fees are in ESL Coin, some of which is converted to ether to pay miners for securing academic records.
```

### TranslationPro D.App.
Using AI technology, users can get instant AI translation from English to a variety of different languages. Users desiring optimal translation output may request to have the AI output be reviewed by a pool of language natives. This system allows natives of foreign languages make passive income on the side in the from of ESLCoin tokens which can be spent on other ESLCoin services in the future or sold at an exchange for FIAT currency.
